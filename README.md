# Simple (yet helpful) browser extensions

Browser extensions created to remove the unnecessary content: ads, blocking (non-scrolling) sections, windows, etc.

### Current list:

#### Quora

Created Firefox extension to get into Quora and read answers *without need to signup*.

#### MIT Tech Review

Wanted to read article at MIT Tech Review (at that time, used incognito tab). It asked me to switch to non-incognito, or buy subscription. Therefore, I made an extension that simply removes the section that blocks me from reading.
